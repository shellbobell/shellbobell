# About me:
<p>♎ I am learning to use GitHub for a career transition from Operational/Process Engineering to Data Analytics-Engineering.  I currently work as an Operations Manager for Alternative Fuels system in a cement plant where we burn solid processed waste material to supplement natural gas in our pyroprocess.  I also have a background in database management, GIS, and mapping.  I've worked in several sectors: Health care, Oil and gas, Mining, and Materials manufacturing.  As a logical thinker, I've always gravitated towards programming and automation 💻.  I'm leaning towards data analytics because it incorporates the following things that I enjoy: programming, analysis, critical-thinking, complex mathematics, statistics, organization, database management, and, of course, 😍 beautifying visualize for everyone to understand the data.</p>

🌱 I’m currently working on on Microsoft Certification for Data Analytics, GitHub portfolio, and a website to showcase projects.
